║  WAVE APP - PLESK DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST                   ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

STEP 1: BUILD LOCALLY ✅ (DONE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Ran "npm run build" in backend folder
✅ Created passenger-app.js startup file
✅ Fixed server.ts to work with Passenger


STEP 2: UPLOAD TO PLESK ⏳ (YOUR TURN)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Upload these files to api.metrocraft.eu:

□ backend/dist/ folder
□ backend/node_modules/ folder (or run "npm install" in Plesk)
□ backend/package.json
□ backend/package-lock.json
□ backend/.env
□ passenger-app.js (from root folder)


STEP 3: CONFIGURE PLESK NODE.JS ⏳ (YOUR TURN)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Go to: Websites & Domains → api.metrocraft.eu → Node.js

□ Application mode: Production
□ Application startup file: passenger-app.js
□ Application root: /httpdocs (or your upload path)
□ Click "Enable Node.js" or "Restart App"


STEP 4: CHECK LOGS ⏳ (YOUR TURN)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Go to: Websites & Domains → api.metrocraft.eu → Protokolle

Look for:
□ "Wave API loaded successfully for Passenger" ✅
□ "Passenger will handle port binding" ✅
□ No error messages ✅


STEP 5: TEST ⏳ (YOUR TURN)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
□ Visit https://api.metrocraft.eu/health
□ Should see: {"status":"ok",...}
□ Visit https://metrocraft.eu
□ Try login: lokzu2 / ml120998
□ Check if chat works


WHAT CHANGED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Server now detects Passenger and doesn't try to bind to port
✅ Created passenger-app.js that properly exports Express app
✅ Added admin routes to backend server
✅ Rebuilt dist/ folder with all fixes


IF IT DOESN'T WORK:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Copy the error from Protokolle and send it to me!

Or consider Railway.app - it's easier for Node.js + WebSocket apps.
